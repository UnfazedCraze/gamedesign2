Garden of Memories Game

Summary
Garden of Memories is a combat based RPG farming game with inspiration from JRPGs. Team Torchwood made this game as a part of the Game Design II curriculum at UW Madison. 

How to Play the Game
You navigate through this agricultural world through the main character. With a set amount of action points that are assigned to you in the beginning of the farming round, you want to plant seeds to grow plants that will help you defend the lands from monsters that are creating chaos. Combine harvested plants on the crafting table to create a variety of weapons. 

For the purpose of our initial demo, we scaled our project down. Start the farming phase with seeds A, B, and C provided on the right. Planting them consumes 2 AP.You can move around the map as much as you want.

After you're done planting your seeds, hit the Ready button. Remember that once you hit the button you will be no longer able to plant any more seeds, and your AP left will be wasted.

After you hit the ready button, you enter the combat phase. In this demo version, we provide two different weapons: a melee weapon and a throwable potion. These weapons need to be created out of plants, so you need to harvest your previously planted. To harvest, simply move onto the tile and click the "harvest" button. Remember, in the combat phase, you can only move 2 tiles each turn. 

After you've got the materials, you can now craft the weapons. To open the crafting table, simple click on the green square next to the "crafting table" text. Click it again if you want to close the menu. The crafting recipes are:
Plant A + Plant C = Melee 1, ATK=2, Durability=5, Range=1
Plant B + Plant C = Potion 1, ATK=4, Range=2, splashes to adjacent tiles with the same damage
Click on the plant icons on the crafting table to put them into the slots. Click on the slots containing these items to get it back if you put the wrong item. After you put all needed ingredients into the slots, the weapon/potion will appear in the product slot, and just click on it to retrieve.

After you've crafted the weapon/potion, you can use them against the monsters that are spawn when you hit the "Ready" button. Drag and drop the sword/potion icon in the bottom. You can only attack within the attack range of the weapon.

After you're done with your movement this turn, click on the "next round" button. Enemies will approach you and attempt to deal damage to you. You will lose the game if your HP becomes lower than or equal to 0, and you win by defeating all monsters. There is also a "turn limitation" system in the game, in which you neither defeat nor victory by passing a given number of turns. This is designed to prevent the case in which you do not have enough resources to fight the monsters.
